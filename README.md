# Platzi Test

I've created this react app like a technical test to join in the Platzi Team like frontend developer. I would like to say that react is not my principal strength in frontend (I'm more an Angular boy) but sound nice to learn more.

Demo: [https://platzitest-56ad3.firebaseapp.com/](https://platzitest-56ad3.firebaseapp.com/)

I've created this app using this:

- React
- React Router
- Redux
- WebPack
- Stylus
- React Bootstrap
- RcIf

I've used the movie database API for this project and created a couple non official assets.

## Run

If you wish to run the project my suggestion is that you clone or download a tag but if you wish to use an unestable branch good luck.

### npm i
----

This is same than any other node project install the dependencies

### npm run start
---

Using this one you will launch a local server with webapck in http://localhost:8080

### npm run build
---

Finally if you wish to create a compiled version just run this command this will be located on the dist folder.
